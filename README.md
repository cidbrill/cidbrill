<h3>Git Commands Cheatsheet:</h3>

Here are five Git commands with their descriptions, required parameters, and examples of how to use them, which I have already utilized while learning the basics of Git and GitHub.

1. **git init** - this command initializes an empty repository on your local machine, and later, you can include it on GitHub. The init option has various parameters, and one of them is the &lt;directory&gt; which specifies where you wish to initialize the local repository. <br>
    **Example:**
    > &gt; git init C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\GitHub

2. **git add** - as its syntax suggests, involves placing your files in the *staged changes* area. These changes can then be committed to be saved in your local repository and subsequently pushed to your remote repository. One of the multiple parameters that this option accepts is simply a "." (period), effectively adding all your files to the *staged changes*. <br>
    **Example:**
    > &gt; git add .

3. **git commit** - as stated previously, files that were added in the *staged changes* area are later saved to the local repository using the git commit command. To simplify this, you can use the "-m" option, which takes a string that serves as a short description for the commitment. <br>
    **Example:**
    > &gt; git commit -m "Repository Initialization
    &gt;
    &gt; Initialized README, LICENSE, and .gitignore files of this repository"

    **Note:** Line Breaks/New Lines are placed between the first and the next lines since Git Commit interprets the initial line as the Commit Header and the following lines as the Commit Description.

4. **git push** - once you've completed committing and saving your *staged changes* in the local repository, it's recommended to synchronize your remote repository with these changes. This synchronization is achieved by using the git push command to push the changes from your local repository to the remote repository. Additionally, you have the option to establish an upstream relationship for your remote branch using the "-u" option, which requires parameters such as &lt;remote&gt; and &lt;branch&gt;. <br>
    **Example:**
    > &gt; git push -u origin main

5. **git pull** - in relation to the git push command, git pull is used to fetch changes from the remote repository and integrate them into the local repository. This process is crucial for maintaining synchronization between your local and remote repositories. The "--rebase" option can be added to the git pull command to rebase your local changes, and it also takes parameters such as &lt;remote&gt; and &lt;branch&gt;. This becomes especially useful when changes have been made to the main branch of your repository while you're in the midst of modifying code, and you need to incorporate your changes. <br>
    **Example:**
    > &gt; git pull --rebase origin main

Furthermore, here are two additional Git Commands that we've utilized.

6. **git branch** - this command involves branch modifications. For example, when you create a new branch using this command, it takes a parameter &lt;branch&gt; which serves as the name of the new branch that will be created. <br>
    **Example:**
    > &gt; git branch branch1

7. **git checkout** - this command is used in preparation for working with a branch. It takes a parameter &lt;branch&gt; which activates and switches to the specified branch, allowing the user to perform actions within that branch. <br>
    **Example:**
    > &gt; git checkout branch1
